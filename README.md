# asu-canvas-dark-mode
 A Chrome extension. Enables a dark theme for ASU's Canvas pages. Also slightly redesigns the main Dashboard page for clarity.
 
 Uses CSS for switching the color palette to a dark version.
 Uses JavaScript to read some of the data on the Dashboard page and replace it with a trimmed version that makes things look less cluttered.
 Uses a combination of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Chrome extension technology to have the night mode be toggleable via a button that appears when you click the extension icon next to the search bar on canvas.asu.edu pages (only on v0.3.0 and up). 

 A way for me to learn CSS, JavaScript, and other browser-related technology. Things will get better as my skills improve.
