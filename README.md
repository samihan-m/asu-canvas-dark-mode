# asu-canvas-dark-mode
 A Chrome extension. Enables a dark theme for ASU's Canvas pages. Also slightly redesigns the page for a less cluttered look.

 Also a way for me to learn CSS and JavaScript. Things will get better as my skills improve.
 
 v0.3.0 and up has a Toggle button that shows up when you click the search bar icon on canvas.asu.edu pages.
